### About Science Gothic

Science Gothic™ is a libre sans serif variable font. The medium weight is based closely on Morris Fuller Benton’s Bank Gothic (1930–34) for American Typefounders. Science Gothic adds four design axes: extreme weight and width, plus contrast (Y Opaque or ‘YOPQ’and slant), a lowercase, and extensive language coverage. Science Gothic is a team effort, by Thomas Phinney, Brandon Buerkle and Vassil Kateliev. Special thanks to Igor Freiberger for his early contributions.
